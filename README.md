Based on the files provided, the application seems to be named **PgpHelper** and appears to involve a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) project likely intended for handling PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption or decryption functions. Below is an overview of its potential use case and a README file for the project.

### Use Case
The **PgpHelper** application is designed to assist users with PGP encryption and decryption tasks. PGP is a standard for securing emails, files, and other types of sensitive information. With this application, users can encrypt and decrypt data easily within a graphical interface built using WPF. This functionality is particularly valuable for organizations or individuals who need to secure sensitive communications and data transfers.

#### Key Features (Assumed)
1. **PGP Encryption** - Allows users to encrypt files or text.
2. **PGP Decryption** - Allows users to decrypt encrypted files or text.
3. **Key Management** - May provide options for importing, exporting, or managing PGP keys.
4. **User Interface** - Built with WPF, providing a user-friendly design to facilitate encryption and decryption.
